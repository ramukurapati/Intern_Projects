# Code Standards for Efficient Development

This document outlines the essential **coding standards** to follow for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. These guidelines help ensure consistency, readability, and quality in the codebase, benefiting both individual developers and the team as a whole.

---

## 1. Code Formatting

### Consistency
- **Indentation**: Use 2 or 4 spaces for indentation (avoid tabs).
    - Example (4 spaces):
      ```python
      def example_function():
          if condition:
              print("True")
      ```

- **Line Length**: Limit line length to 80-120 characters. Break long lines logically using line continuation (e.g., for function arguments, strings).

- **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code (e.g., functions, classes, imports).
    - Example:
      ```python
      def calculate_sum(a, b):
          return a + b

      def print_result(sum):
          print(f"Result: {sum}")
      ```

---

## 2. Naming Conventions

### Descriptive Names
- **Variables**: Use `snake_case` for variables (lowercase with underscores).
    - Example: `total_amount`, `user_input`.
    
- **Functions**: Use `snake_case` for functions.
    - Example: `calculate_total()`, `get_user_input()`.
    
- **Classes**: Use `CamelCase` for class names (start each word with an uppercase letter).
    - Example: `UserProfile`, `DataProcessor`.

- **Constants**: Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants.
    - Example: `MAX_RETRIES = 5`.

---

## 3. Comments and Documentation

### Inline Comments
- Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code’s intent is unclear.
    - Example:
      ```python
      # Initialize the counter for tracking retries
      retry_count = 0
      ```

### Docstrings
- Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules. Follow the standard format to describe the purpose, parameters, and return values.
    - Example:
      ```python
      def calculate_area(radius):
          """
          Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
          
          Parameters:
          radius (float): The radius of the circle.
          
          Returns:
          float: The area of the circle.
          """
          return 3.14159 * radius ** 2
      ```

---

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

### Exception Handling
- Handle exceptions properly. Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle errors, and never leave them unhandled.
    - Example:
      ```python
      try:
          result = divide(10, 0)
      except ZeroDivisionError as e:
          print(f"Error: {e}")
      ```

### Logging
- Use logging instead of print statements for debugging and tracking errors.
    - Example:
      ```python
      import logging
      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
      logging.info("This is an info message")
      ```

---

## 5. Code Efficiency

### Avoid Redundant Calculations
- Avoid repeating calculations or calls that return the same value.
    - Example:
      ```python
      # Inefficient
      for i in range(100):
          value = calculate_heavy_task()
          process(value)
      
      # Efficient
      value = calculate_heavy_task()  # Calculate once
      for i in range(100):
          process(value)
      ```

### Use Built-in Functions
- Use built-in functions and libraries, which are usually faster and more optimized.
    - Example (use `sum()` instead of a loop to sum elements):
      ```python
      # Inefficient
      total = 0
      for num in numbers:
          total += num
          
      # Efficient
      total = sum(numbers)
      ```

---

## 6. Avoiding Code Duplication

### DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- Reuse code as much as possible. If you find yourself writing the same block of code in multiple places, create a function or a class to handle it.
    - Example:
      ```python
      # Instead of this
      def calculate_salary(employee):
          return employee.base_salary + employee.bonus

      def calculate_tax(employee):
          return employee.base_salary * 0.2

      # Do this
      def calculate_pay(employee):
          return employee.base_salary + employee.bonus - employee.base_salary * 0.2
      ```

---

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Time Complexity
- Optimize code by minimizing the complexity of algorithms (e.g., avoid `O(n^2)` operations when `O(n)` is possible).

### Space Complexity
- Be mindful of memory usage. Avoid holding large datasets in memory when it’s not necessary.
    - Example (use a generator to process large datasets one item at a time instead of loading everything in memory):
      ```python
      # Inefficient (loads entire dataset into memory)
      data = [process(x) for x in range(1000000)]
      
      # Efficient (use a generator to process one item at a time)
      def process_data():
          for x in range(1000000):
              yield process(x)
      ```

---

## 8. Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected.
    - Example:
      ```python
      import unittest

      def add(a, b):
          return a + b

      class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
          def test_add(self):
              self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

      if __name__ == '__main__':
          unittest.main()
      ```

### Test Coverage
- Aim for 80% or higher test coverage, depending on your project’s complexity.

---

## 9. Version Control Best Practices

### Commits
- Commit frequently with clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message describes the "why" of a change, not just the "what".
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Fix bug in calculate_area function for negative radius values"
      ```

### Branching
- Use feature branches for specific tasks, and keep `main` or `master` stable.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout -b fix-bug-in-calculation
      ```

---

## 10. Code Reviews and Collaboration

### Code Reviews
- Regular code reviews help improve code quality and identify potential issues early.
    - Focus on:
      - **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
      - **Efficiency**: Is the code optimized for performance?
      - **Correctness**: Does the code do what it’s supposed to do?
      - **Testing**: Are there sufficient tests?

---

## 11. Security Best Practices

### Avoid Hardcoding Secrets
- Never hardcode sensitive information like passwords, keys, or tokens in your code. Use environment variables or configuration files that are not included in the codebase.
    - Example (use environment variables):
      ```python
      import os
      API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
      ```

### Sanitize User Input
- Always sanitize and validate user input to avoid SQL injections, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.

---

## 12. Refactoring

### Refactor Regularly
- As the codebase evolves, it’s important to refactor and improve the code for better maintainability and efficiency. This includes removing dead code, simplifying complex functions, and making the codebase more modular.

---

## 13. Scalability

### Scalable Code Design
- Design your code to be scalable. For example, when working with large datasets, use pagination or batch processing to handle data incrementally.
    - Example (using batch processing):
      ```python
      def process_in_batches(data, batch_size):
          for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):
              process(data[i:i + batch_size])
      ```

---

## Conclusion

Following these coding standards ensures that your code is readable, maintainable, efficient, and secure. By adhering to these guidelines, developers can collaborate more effectively, improve the quality of their code, and prevent common issues. These principles are essential for creating scalable and high-quality software.
